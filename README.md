# üõ†Ô∏è Instructions:

## REQUIREMENTS: NODEJS MUST BE INSTALLED

Run the following command to install the necessary modules:

`npm install`

Create two files: [data.txt](data.txt) and [proxy.txt](proxy.txt)

For those using multiple accounts, it's recommended to use a proxy (if using only one account, there's no need to create the proxy.txt file).

# Proxy format:

http://user:pass@ip:port

# Get data:

In the data.txt file, you need to have the following format:

query_id=xxx or user=xxxx
